Privacy Policy for Cashtrax
Last Updated: June 20, 2025

Thank you for using our Cashtrax application. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we protect it. Your privacy is critically important to us.

1. Information We Collect

Our application is designed to be your private financial tool. We collect only the information necessary for the app to function:

Account Information: When you sign up, we collect your email address and a securely hashed password. This is used solely to create your account and allow you to log in securely across multiple devices.

Expense Data: We collect the expense information you voluntarily enter into the app. This includes the date, description, amount, and category for each expense.

Recurring Expense Rules: We collect the rules you create for recurring expenses, such as the description, amount, category, and frequency.

We do not collect any other personal information, location data, or usage analytics from your device.

2. How We Use and Protect Your Information

Your data's security is our top priority.

Data Storage: All of your data (account information and expense data) is stored securely in Google's Firebase services (Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore).

Data Security: Your data is protected by robust security rules. These rules ensure that only you (the authenticated user) can read or write your own financial data. No other user of the application can ever access your information, and we, the developers, do not have access to your individual expense entries.

Data Sharing: We do not, and will not, share, sell, or rent your personal information or financial data with any third parties for any purpose.

3. Data Control

You have full control over your data. At any time, you can log in to the application to add, view, edit, or delete any of your expense entries. If you wish to delete your entire account and all associated data, please contact us.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
